    question: "What is the chemical symbol for water?",
    answer:
      "The chemical symbol for water is H2O. This means that each molecule of water is composed of two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to one oxygen atom. Water is essential for all known forms of life and has unique properties, such as its ability to dissolve many substances, its high specific heat capacity, and its solid state (ice) being less dense than its liquid state. These properties make water a vital component in various biological, chemical, and physical processes.",

    question: "What are the causes and effects of climate change?",
    answer:
      "Climate change is primarily caused by the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, resulting from human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to a rise in global temperatures, also known as global warming. The effects of climate change are widespread and include more frequent and severe weather events, rising sea levels, melting polar ice caps, shifts in ecosystems and wildlife populations, and impacts on human health and agriculture. Addressing climate change requires a combination of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and implementing adaptation strategies to manage the impacts already occurring.",
